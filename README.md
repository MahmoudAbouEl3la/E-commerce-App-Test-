# 🛒 E-Commerce App Task

## Overview

This is a simple e-commerce Flutter app I built as a task. It includes:

- ✅ Login with API credentials
- 🛍️ View all products
- 🔍 Search functionality
- ❤️ Wishlist using local storage

I used **Cubit** for state management and followed a **Clean Architecture** approach.  
For local data, I used **Hive** — and since I wasn’t very experienced with Hive, I used **ChatGPT** to help solve some issues like registering adapters and managing complex objects in local storage.

## 🔐 Login Feature

I used the [Fake Store API](https://fakestoreapi.com/docs) for login.

### Credentials used:

```json
{
  "username": "mor_2314",
  "password": "83r5^_"
}
```
